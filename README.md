# MKT Code Sample

Aceable is getting into the flying robot pilot licensing market. As a marketing web developer, your job will be to create a landing page for our products. This first code sample is to make sure that the products look correct in the API and that we can present relevant information about each.

## Your Task

For this sample, we want you to:

*   Create a simple Vue app
*   Make a GET request to the products API endpoint at https://mkt-endpoint.now.sh/products
*   Sort the products in the response by lowest price to highest.
*   Iterate through each product and present the title, price **in US dollars**, and description of each.

## How-To

To take this code sample, we need you to:

*   Download this repo, **do not fork it**.
*   Complete the exercise locally.
*   Zip up your resulting code and attach it in a reply to geni@aceable.com
